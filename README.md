# COP3530 Project 3
Developed by Carter Johnson, Mira Menon, and Vincent Fleming

# Problem
We would like to analyze and reduce search times in a randomly generated database storing user information.

# Motivation
For large companies that support hundreds of thousands of users, it is important to provide access to user information in the most effective way possible.

# Features
By comparing two different search algorithms, we will compare the speeds of the two search algorithms, ultimately determining which algorithm is more effective.

# Data
userData(ssn, user_name)

# Tech Stack
Python - data generation <br />
C++ - data structure implementation and analysis <br />
Git - version control 

# Distribution of Roles
Carter Johnson - data generation & data structure implementation
Mira Menon - sorting algorithms & data structure implementation
Vincent Fleming - github version control & data strucutre implementation
